      I bet you've tried it already (or you've seen it happen): you wander into
      an art forum, and announce you would like to learn how to draw. The first
      advice you usually get is “draw a lot”, or “practice practice practice”.
      And this is exactly what you should be doing. Your drawing skills won't
      improve just by reading about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, drawing the same mistake over and over again is not the most
      efficient way to improve your skills. The first part of the tutorial will
      show you some of the basic principles, and hopefully will help you to
      practice in a more focused way.
    </p>
    <p>
      For now, we'll stick with realism. Don't let this discourage you if your
      favorite style isn't realistic, though! Unless you're an abstract artist,
      the basis of your favorite style is the world around you. So let's tackle
      that first, it's difficult enough already without adding all sorts of
      stylistic conventions.

      The second bit of advice a beginning artist usually gets is “draw from
      life”. And it is excellent advice! After all, if you can't draw what is
      right in front of you, you certainly won't be able to draw what you see in
      your imagination either. But the advice is a bit short, and will usually
      leave the artist behind unsure of what to do next. This chapter will help
      you to get started by explaining some different sketching methods you can
      use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Materials? Ah yes. No tutorial would be complete without discussing the
      materials first. It's tradition!
    </p>

      So... a ream of the cheapest copier paper you can find, or in a pinch, the
      inside of a pizza box. A pencil, a burned match, or anything else that
      leaves a mark. And a pencil sharpener or a knife to keep it sharp. Don't
      worry about fancy stuff like erasers just yet.
    </p>
    <h2 id="basics-sketching-organic">Organic shapes</h2>
    <p>
      The most important thing to keep in mind is to start with the largest
      shapes, and gradually work down to the small details. This allows you to
      regularly check your angles and proportions. The earlier you catch a
      mistake, the easier it will be to fix it. The idea is to draw imaginary
      lines through the important points of your subject, and use a couple of
      checks to make sure they are accurate, such as using easy divisions
      (halves and thirds), and checking against horizontal and vertical lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best way to explain this is by example. Let's make a sketch of what is
      possibly the fandom's most popular critter, the red fox:
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-sketching-foxphoto">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/fox-photo.webp"
        alt="Photo of a red fox"
      />
      <figcaption>
        <strong
          >Figure 1.2. <a href="#credit-thyssen">Photo of a red fox</a></strong
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      The first step is to block in the large shapes. On the left you can see
      the imaginary lines I've picked as the basis. The sketch is still very
      light at this point: the idea is to make the corrections on the fly,
      instead of slowing yourself down by erasing lines.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-sketching-fox1annot">
      <img

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      Now pause and check if everything is still correct. I'm going to give a
      few examples of what you could look for, so you can get a rough idea of
      this process.
    </p>

      The proportions are okay: the line through the eyes is supposed to be a
      bit below halfway (say, at 5/8ths) the lines of the ear tips and the chin.
      Also, if I draw an imaginary line from the intersection near the left eye
      to the right ear tip, or from the mouth to the ear's base, the angle is
      the same on the sketch.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-sketching-fox2cannot">

    <p>
      Eyeballing diagonal lines through your figure is called “caliper vision”
      by [<a href="#biblio-ryd">Ryd</a>]. Ryder uses the block-in and the
      caliper measurement only on the contour, not on features inside the
      contour such as eyes or a mouth. Personally, I prefer using the same
      system for the entire subject. It's only a tool, how you use it is up to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line through the eyes doesn't have quite the right angle though. It
      should be rotated clockwise a bit. I'm keeping this in mind as I use this
      line to place the eyes in the next step:
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-sketching-fox2annot">
      <img

    <br />
    <p>
      With the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth indicated, it's time for a check
      again. If we look at one of the original construction lines, it's easy to
      spot the mistake here. The cheek is way too close to this line.
    </p>
    <br />

      The top of the head seems okay; the distance to the eye line is the same
      as the distance from the eye line to the chin. Or, from the eye line up to
      the ear tip line, it's approximately at two-thirds.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      The cheek is fixed, and the sketch is really starting to take shape now. I
      added some details and shading to show how the process would continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      I realize this bears an eerie resemblance to the many “How to draw a
      &lt;insert subject here&gt;” tutorials. But although I could add a jarring
      background, post it to DeviantArt, and call it a day (tempting,
      tempting...), I hope it's clear that this is not the intention. I'm not
      trying to teach you how to draw a fox, not yet at least. I'm just showing
      you how to approach a sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
      These techniques are not just for copying photos, you can also sketch from
      life in the same way. It is a little more difficult, so if you'd like to
      practice with 2-D references first that's okay. Instead of drawing blue
      construction lines on a photo, some people use a thin knitting neeule or a
      piece of thread. You hold it in front of you while closing one eye, and
      check if everything lines up the same way as on your paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now go grab your pencil and your cheap paper, and sketch whatever you find
      interesting. It doesn't matter if it is a pet, a person, or the
      spontaneous still life on your desk. The goal right now is to learn to
      draw what you see, develop your sense of proportions and angles, and train
      your eye-hand coordination.
    </p>
    <h2 id="basics-sketching-geometric">Geometric shapes</h2>
    <p>
      A lot of subjects can be simplified to geometric shapes, such as boxes,
      pyramids, cylinders, and spheres. Instead of starting with the large
      shapes on paper, you simplify your subject in 3-D.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section is also a crash course in perspective drawing. You'll need
      this to draw the basic shapes, but it is also a useful tool in case you
      don't have a reference for something, or if you don't want to make a
      perfect copy. As long as you work according to the rules, it will look
      good.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll look at perspective in more detail in chapter 9. All you need to
      remember for now is that lines that are parallel in the real world, will
      converge to a single point in your drawing. Such points are called
      vanishing points.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, the cube. Here you can see how parallel lines intersect at a common
      point:
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-sketching-cubeperspective">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/cube-perspective.webp"
        alt="A cube and two vanishing points"
      />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 1.8. A cube and two vanishing points</strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      The cube is transparent, so you can see all its edges. There are four
      parallel edges with the vanishing point on the left, another four with the
      vanishing point on the right, and four edges that we are looking at
      straight on. (Their vanishing point is so far away we can ignore it, and
      draw the lines vertical.)
    </p>
    <p>
      By placing the vanishing points more to the left or to the right, we can
      rotate the cube.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-sketching-cuberotate">
      <img
        loading="lazy"

        <strong>Figure 1.9. Drawing the cube from different angles</strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      If we tilt the cube with the top towards the viewer, the third vanishing
      point (the one that was too far away at first) comes into view.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-sketching-cube3vp">

    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      The center of one of the sides of a box can be found by drawing a cross
      between the corners. If we know the exact midule of the top side of a
      cube, we can use this point as the tip of a pyramid:
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-sketching-cubepyramid">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/cube-pyramid.webp"
        alt="Finding the midule of a face, and constructing a pyramid"
      />
      <figcaption>
        <strong
          >Figure 1.11. Finding the midule of a face, and constructing a
          pyramid</strong
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      By adding two more lines through the center, you can divide a side into 4
      smaller squares. You can use this as a guide for drawing a circle in
      perspective. The circle will always touch the edges of the square in the
      midule, at the point where we have drawn the extra two guidelines. And it
      will cross the diagonals at a little less than three quarters from the
      center.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-sketching-cylinder">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/cylinder.webp"
        alt="Constructing a circle from a square, and a cylinder from a cube"
      />
      <figcaption>
        <strong
          >Figure 1.12. Constructing a circle from a square, and a cylinder from
          a cube</strong
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      The cube is drawn transparently here to make it clearer how both the top
      and the bottom face are turned into a circle in correct perspective. Note
      that the straight sides of the cylinder are parallel to the upright edges
      of the cube, and therefor have the same vanishing point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cylinders of various lengths are often used to draw a character's body. So
      practice a bit with drawing them at different angles, this will help you
      with foreshortening later on.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-sketching-cylindersrotate">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/cylinders-rotate.webp"
        alt="Long cylinders at different angles"
      />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 1.13. Long cylinders at different angles</strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      Here you can see a longer, thinner cylinder drawn at three different
      angles. Two are exactly perpendicular, so they use the same two vanishing
      points (which are located outside the drawing). The one that we are
      viewing lengthwise has its own vantage point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's draw something! Man-made objects are great subjects to simplify
      to geometric shapes:
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-sketching-perspectivephoto">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/perspective-photo.webp"
        alt="Photo with strong perspective distortion"
      />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 1.14. Photo with strong perspective distortion</strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      This photo has been taken from up close with a wide angle, to exaggerate
      the effect of perspective. Don't put your vanishing points this close
      together in your own drawings, unless you're using the exaggeration for
      some effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The edges of the table and the base of the laptop share the same two
      vantage points. They are outside the paper, to the top left and the top
      right. There's also a third vantage point for all vertical edges (such as
      the leg of the table and the sides of the bottle), far down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start with the basic shapes: a flat box for the table, another one for the
      base of the laptop. And just like Juan Gris, we're going to make a bottle
      out of a cylinder. Some construction lines end in an arrow; if the drawing
      were bigger, these lines would be longer and meet at the vanishing point.

      I've drawn crosses on the laptop base and screen to find the line that
      runs right through the midule. I use this line to place the latch, and to
      determine where the curve at the top of the screen reaches its highest
      point. More guidelines towards the vantage points are used to draw the
      keyboard and the trackpad.
    </p>

      The top of the water bottle was added using the center line as a guide.
      The center line runs through the midule of the top and the midule of the
      bottom, and we already found those by drawing crosses.
    </p>
    <h2 id="basics-sketching-sphere">Spheres and guidelines</h2>
    <p>
      A sphere with guidelines is a popular basic shape for drawing heads. While
      it is not as important as the other sketching techniques, you are going to
      see it a lot throughout this tutorial, especially in the chapters about
      animal anatomy and anthros.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now a sphere is easy enough; you grab a compass, draw a circle, there's
      your sphere. However, we'll also need some guidelines, and that's the
      tricky bit. Here, take a look at some examples.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-sketching-sphere1">
      <img loading="lazy" src="images/spheres-1.webp" alt="Spheres" />
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 1.18. Spheres</strong></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      As you can see, I've drawn three lines on the sphere. A horizontal one,
      and two vertical ones. Also, there's arrow sticking out. This indicates
      where the nose points to. We're going to use these guidelines to locate
      the facial features, and make sure our characters don't end up looking
      like a Guernica reject.
    </p>
    <p>
      A guideline on a sphere will look like an ellipse if it turns away from
      the viewer. Drawing an ellipse takes some practice, and I'll show you a
      couple of things you'll need to keep an eye on. First of all, there are
      six points on the sphere's surface where the guidelines cross each other.
      The point where the arrow is sticking out is one of them. A straight line
      between two opposite intersections passes through the midule (where you
      put the neeule of your compass). You can see that in the next figure on
      the left:

    <p>
      On the right you see something similar, but this time it's for the points
      where the ellipse touches the outer circle. Again, a straight line through
      two opposite points goes through the midule.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ellipse must also be symmetrical. Check if the distance to the center
      is the same on both sides:
    </p>
    <br />

      <figcaption><strong>Figure 1.20. Symmetry</strong></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      Don't sweat it, though. These are just a couple of things you can use to
      judge your ellipse by eye. You shouldn't go and break out a ruler to get
      it absolutely perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Okay, let's do something useful with it. The horizontal guideline is used
      often for placing the eyes. You already know in what direction your
      character is looking, so all you need to do is to place the eyes at the
      same distance from the center. I've indicated the measurements in red, and
      the eyes themselves in blue:

    <p>
      Using the two vertical guidelines, we can do the same for ears. Again, the
      red arrows show the measurements taken to make sure everything is
      symmetrical.

    <h2 id="basics-sketching-exercises">Exercises</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Draw from life and from photos. If I had to write a tutorial in six
        words, this would be it.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are using a reference photo, copy it upside down. This way, you
        force yourself to concentrate more on the edges and proportions, instead
        of what they represent. This also makes it easier to spot your own
        mistakes when comparing your sketch to the photo right side up.
      </li>
      <li>
        After drawing from a photo, or even better, from real life, look at your
        sketch in a mirror. This is a good way to spot if your drawing is
        slanted. Next time, keep this slant in mind and try to compensate for
        it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drawing a straight line is easy, they invented rulers for that. But you
        can save yourself some time if you can do it freehand. You'll have to
        work from the shoulder and the elbow for this, and it may take some time
        to get good results. Try drawing your guidelines without a ruler, and
        use a ruler afterward to check how close you are to a straight line.

    <p>
      Before we start, I'd like to point out that knowledge of human anatomy is
      not a replacement for studying the body from real life or photos. So keep
      cranking out those sketches! (And hoarding those Victoria's Secret
      catalogs and similar magazines. Strictly for reference, of course.) But it
      will help you to recognize the features you are drawing, and it will
      certainly come in handy when you don't have a perfect ref to work from.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll start with the largest bones and muscle masses. It's not enough to
      make you a surgeon (well... a successful one at least), but you'll be able
      to identify most of the bumps and bits on the body, and understand how
      they work. Then we're going to take a look at poses, and ways to abstract
      the body. And gesture drawing. Ah, so much to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would also like to apologize in advance for using the Latin names of the
      bones and muscles. You don't need to know their names to draw them, you
      can't impress your friends with it, much less pick up a date, so what's
      the use? If you are asking for critique, it is very likely others will use
      jargon when explaining what you could do better next time. It's also
      useful to cross-reference this tutorial with other sources.

    <p>
      The human body is usually measured in units of heads. Most adults are
      around seven and a half heads high, but for practical and aesthetic
      reasons most diagrams show eight heads. It's not a big deal, just remember
      the head can be slightly larger in real life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless you are drawing an adult that is standing up straight, you can't
      use this diagram directly. Instead, you'll have to use this as a guideline
      to determine how large something will end up after foreshortening, or in
      proportion to other parts of the body. Here are a few examples of such
      guidelines:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Arms are 3½ heads long.</li>
      <li>
        When the arms are hanging down, the elbows line up with the bottom of
        the ribcage, and the fingertips reach halfway the upper leg.
      </li>
      <li>
        The navel is positioned roughly halfway between the nipples and the
        crotch, and halfway between the bottom of the ribcage and the top of the
        pelvis. A common mistake is to place it too low.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are also several proportion guidelines that are not obvious from
      this diagram:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The distance between the fingertips of the sideways outstretched arms is
        equal to the length of the body.
      </li>
      <li>The forearm is 1.7 times the length of the hand.</li>
      <li>The hand can cover the face (from hairline to chin).</li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <h3>Bones</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Collarbone</li>
      <p>
        The function of the collarbone (or clavicle) is to help keep the
        shoulder in place. When you roll your shoulders, the collarbones move
        along. It runs from the top of the ribcage to the shoulder socket. It is
        almost straight when seen from the front, but from above it follows a
        slight S-curve.
      </p>
      <li>Sternum</li>
      <p>
        This is a large, flat bone that connects the clavicles and ribs at the
        front of the body, and serves as the anchor point for the pectoral
        muscle, and a few neck muscles. When you breathe in, this bone moves
        forward and upward.
      </p>
      <li>Ribcage</li>
      <p>
        The ribs (ten on each side, plus two pairs of floating ribs) are a
        rather complex whole, but it helps a lot to remember the ribcage is
        shaped like an egg. The underside of the ribcage can be somewhat
        visible, especially when breathing in or lifting your arms. Only when
        someone has very little fat, you can see the individual ribs, and you
        should pay attention to how they curve.
      </p>
      <br />

    </ul>
    <h3>Muscles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Trapezius</li>
      <p>
        Only a small portion of the trapezius is visible here. We'll look at
        this muscle in more detail in the next section.
      </p>
      <li>Sternocleidomastoideus</li>
      <p>
        This muscle runs from the top of the sternum and the inner third of the
        collarbone, to the skull, underneath and behind the ear. It is one of
        the many muscles that rotate the head. Also, it is a great word for
        hangman.
      </p>
      <br />
      <figure id="basics-humananatomy-sternotrap">

          <strong>Figure 2.4. Sternocleidomastoideus and trapezius</strong>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br />
      <p>
        You will often see this muscle in drawings. Even in simplified styles,
        it shows up as a V-line in the neck. This is the medial head of the
        muscle, and it's more visible because the part where it connects to the
        sternum is tendinous. The outer edge of the other head isn't drawn
        often, but if you draw it, keep in mind that this part runs almost
        vertically upward when seen from the front.
      </p>
      <li>Deltoid</li>
      <p>
        This muscle consists of three heads. One attaches to the clavicle, one
        to the acromion (a projecting part of the shoulder blade), and one to
        the flat side of the shoulder blade. They all connect somewhere halfway
        along the humerus. In this illustration, only the front two heads are
        visible. It is used for moving the arm, especially for raising it.
      </p>
      <li>Pectoralis major (pecs)</li>
      <p>
        A large muscle that covers most of the chest wall. It is connected to
        the sternum and part of the clavicle, and tapers off to a wide, flat
        tendon attached to the humerus. When the arm is hanging down, this
        muscle group makes a 180 degree twist. It untwists when the arm is
        raised.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <br />
      <li>Serratus</li>
      <p>
        This set of muscles connects the ribs to the shoulder blade. Their job
        is to pull the shoulder blade forward. They are visible only in
        muscular, or very thin individuals.

      </figure>
      <br />
      <li>Obliquus</li>
      <p>
        This set of muscles also connects to the ribcage, and they are weaved
        with the serratus. This woven part can sometimes show up as a zig zag
        line. The obliques twist the upper body.
      </p>

      <br />
      <li>Abdominal (abs)</li>
      <p>
        The segmentation of this long, flat muscle is what leads to the six-pack
        look. Its function is to flex the entire upper body forward.
      </p>

    <br />
    <h3>Bones</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Spine</li>
      <p>
        The way the spine is bent is very typical for the way the rest of the
        body is posed. This is why you will often see the spine indicated even
        in the simplest of sketches. In gesture drawing, the spine often follows
        one of the lines of action.
      </p>
      <br />
      <figure id="basics-humananatomy-spine">

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br />
      <p>
        In a relaxed position, the spine follows a double S curve when seen from
        the side. Keep this in mind, the figure will look much better than with
        a ruler-straight back.
      </p>
      <li>Shoulder blade</li>
      <p>
        The shoulder blade is a flat triangle, with connections for the bone of
        the upper arm and for the clavicle. When the shoulder moves, the
        shoulder blade slides across the back of the ribcage.

        This figure shows the shoulder blades, collar bones, and first ribs, as
        seen from the back, looking down. It gives an impression of how the
        shoulder blades are angled, and how these bones relate to one another.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Muscles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Trapezius</li>
      <p>
        The trapezius connects part of the spine, skull, shoulder blades, and
        the outer third of the collarbone. It is used for moving the shoulders
        up (shrugging), backward, or downward, depending on which section of the
        muscle is used. Notice how they smooth out the line from the neck to the
        shoulders; in some simplified styles this muscle is omitted, and the
        neck and shoulders connect at a sharp angle.
      </p>
      <li>Deltoid</li>
      <p>
        All three heads of the deltoid are visible in illustration
        <a href="#basics-humananatomy-backbonesmuscles">2.9</a>.
      </p>
      <li>Infraspinatus, teres major, and teres minor</li>
      <p>
        All these muscles run from the shoulder blade to the shoulder. They move
        the arm towards the body, help in rotating it, and keep the arm in its
        socket.
      </p>
      <li>Latissimus dorsi (lats)</li>
      <p>
        These broad, flat muscles pull the arm downward. In very muscular
        individuals, they are also visible from the front.

      <li>Humerus</li>
      <p>This is the large bone in the upper arm.</p>
      <li>Ulna and radius</li>
      <p>
        The ulna is hinged around the outside of the humerus. It connects to the
        wrist on the side of the little finger.
      </p>
      <p>
        The radius is somewhat smaller, and connects from the inside of the
        humerus to the wrist at the thumb side. Near the wrist this bone is much
        wider.

    <ul>
      <li>Biceps brachii</li>
      <p>
        This is probably the most often drawn muscle. It has two heads that run
        from different parts of the shoulder blade to the radius, and is one of
        the muscles that bend the arm, and turn the hand outward.

      <br />
      <li>Brachialis</li>
      <p>
        This is another elbow flexor. It lies below the biceps. Since it
        connects to the ulna, it doesn't twist the hand around.
      </p>
      <li>Triceps</li>
      <p>
        This is the three-headed muscle on the back of the upper arm. Its job is
        to straighten the arm. It is only defined in more athletic individuals,
        and looks a bit like an upside down 'U'.
      </p>
      <li>Forearm muscles</li>
      <p>
        The two largest muscles of the forearm are indicated in the
        illustration. The brachioradialis helps the biceps to bend the arm, and
        will be most visible when the arm is bent 90 degrees. The extensor carpi
        radialis flexes the wrist. It is less pronounced than the
        brachioradialis, but contributes to the arm's contour when the hand is
        turned with the palm facing up.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <h3>The shoulder</h3>
    <p>
      By now you've probably noticed the arm is connected to the torso by a
      complicated mess of muscles. A few extra illustrations probably won't
      hurt.
    </p>

      Here we have two 3/4 front views, with the arm turned out and in. You can
      see several overlapping, interlocking muscles around the armpit; from
      front to back they are the pectoralis, biceps, latissimus dorsi, triceps,
      and teres. Most people aren't that toned though, so it gets smoothed out.
      In that case you can only discern the two largest masses: the chest and
      the back muscles. The next illustration shows a simplified version;
    </p>

    <br />
    <h3>The elbow</h3>
    <p>
      The contours of the elbow vary a lot, depending on whether the arm is
      stretched out or bent. The following figure explains this by looking at a
      simplified view of the bones and muscles:
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-humananatomy-elbow-bend">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/elbow-bend.webp"
        alt="Bending the elbow"
      />
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 2.19. Bending the elbow</strong></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      The humerus is very wide near the elbow, with a large bit sticking out at
      the inside of the arm (downwards in the illustration). This large bit, the
      inner epicondyle, serves as the anchor point for various muscles that flex
      the wrist. These muscles are only lightly outlined in the drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's also a smaller bit sticking out at the outside of the arm. You
      usually don't see it, but it pushes the forearm muscles outward when the
      arm is fully extended. In the second illustration where the arm is bent 45
      degrees, they pass on the inside of this protrusion, and the widest part
      of the arm is now right below the elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing much happens at 90 degrees, we can see the elbow bone and the
      tendon of the triceps sticking out. But if the arm is bent further, the
      lower arm muscles and the wrist and finger flexors are squished against
      the biceps, and they become visible again.
    </p>
    <h2 id="basics-humananatomy-hands">The hand</h2>
    <p>
      The hands are a notorious source of frustration. This section won't
      concentrate on the muscle structure, since the hand is very complex in
      this regard, and knowing this won't help much in drawing them. Instead,
      we'll look at proportions, range of motion, and possible simplifications.
    </p>
    <h3>Structure and proportions</h3>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-humananatomy-hand-bones">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/hand-bones.webp"
        alt="Bone structure and proportions of the hand"
      />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 2.20. Bone structure and proportions of the hand</strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      There is a very easy and surprisingly accurate way to remember the
      proportions of an adult's hand. Start with a line from the wrist to the
      tip of the midule finger. The knuckle of the midule finger is halfway
      along this line. Divide the top segment in two again, and you get to the
      first joint. Divide again to find the second joint. You could divide it
      again to find the length of the index finger and ring finger, but it's
      easier to just draw them “a bit” shorter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The palm of the hand houses the metacarpal bones. The four bones of the
      fingers will be simplified later on, but there are two things to keep in
      mind. The metacarpal bones of the little and the ring finger are shorter
      than the ones of the midule and index finger. And they are more flexible;
      you can move the knuckles of the little and ring finger up and down
      easily, but not the other two.
    </p>
    <h3>Simplifying the hand</h3>
    <p>
      The palm of the hand can be simplified to a box. A lot of artists leave it
      at that, but we'll add a few more refinements here. First, we'll slice off
      a triangle from one of the corners, so it follows the line of the knuckles
      better. Also, the sides are bent up, and the wrist end is made thicker,
      again to get closer to the actual shape of the palm. We end up with
      something that looks more like a spade:
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-humananatomy-hand-palm-box">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/palm-box.webp"
        alt="Simplifying the palm"
      />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 2.21. Simplifying the palm</strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      Notice that the box does not line up with the contour of the fingers.
      There's a bit of skin between the fingers that makes them seem shorter
      than you'd expect from just looking at the skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two black arrows in the previous figure show how the little finger can
      move up and down. This changes how much you'll have to bend the box on
      that side:
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-humananatomy-hand-frontal">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/hand-frontal-compare.webp"
        alt="Bending the palm"
      />
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 2.22. Bending the palm</strong></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>Take a look at some examples of how to use this model:</p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-humananatomy-hand-example">
      <img loading="lazy" src="images/hand-examples.webp" alt="Some examples" />
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 2.23. Some examples</strong></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      The first one is a relaxed pose. The box is only slightly curved, and the
      bones of the fingers are slightly bent. The other one is more complicated;
      the box is bent much more, bringing the bottom two knuckles towards the
      viewer. The fingers are curled around, and the bones need to be drawn with
      varying degrees of foreshortening.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is certainly not the only way to draw a hand. You'll find examples
      where people build a hand from ovals, boxes, mittens, you name it. As long
      as you understand the hand's structure, it doesn't really matter how you
      abstract it. As you get more experienced, you'll develop your own way of
      doing things anyway.

      </figure>
      <br />
      <li>Femur</li>
      <p>
        The femur has a ball joint at the hip, which is set at an angle. It runs
        from the outside to the center of the leg, making a skeleton seem more
        cross legged than an actual person.
      </p>
      <p>
        When someone is standing up straight, the hip joint is located exactly
        vertically over the foot.
      </p>
      <li>Kneecap</li>
      <p>
        The kneecap is part of the tendons that stretch the leg. It lifts the
        tendons off the joint, and increases the leverage of the quadriceps.
        Since it is part of the tendons that connect to the shin, the kneecap
        will move down when bending the knee.
      </p>
      <li>Tibia and fibula</li>
      <p>These two bones are somewhat shorter than the femur.</p>

      <p>
        The longest muscle in the body. It's not very strong, or clearly visible
        in itself, but it does define the inner edge of the quadriceps. It runs
        from the iliac crest, around the thigh, to a point behind the knee on
        the inside of the leg.
      </p>
      <br />

      </figure>
      <br />
      <li>Gluteus</li>
      <p>
        The main function of the gluteus is to give the buttocks a nice shape.
        (They also stretch the thigh, but that's of secondary importance.) It
        attaches to the back of the pelvis, the femur, and with a long fascia
        (connective tissue) to the tibia, just below the knee joint.
      </p>
      <p>
        The part in the front that looks like a separate muscle, is indeed just
        that. Officially it's called the tensor fasciae latae, in case you want
        to look it up in another anatomy book.
      </p>
      <li>Quadriceps</li>
      <p>
        Its name means “four heads”, but only three of them are clearly visible.
        (The fourth one lies behind the midule head, the rectus femoris.) They
        stretch the knee, and the one head that is connected to the hip bone
        also helps in swinging the leg forward.
      </p>
    </ul>

      <li>Biceps femoris / hamstrings</li>
      <p>
        The hamstrings are the group of four muscles in the back of the thigh
        that bend and rotate the knee. The muscle that is visible from the side
        is called the biceps femoris.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other muscles from the group have the same function, and the tendons
        wedge together with the calf muscles, giving the inside of the knee its
        distinct shape:
      </p>
      <br />
      <figure id="basics-humananatomy-hamstringswedge">

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br />
      <li>Triceps surae</li>
      <p>
        The calf consists of two muscles, the gastrocnemius and the soleus. They
        both connect to the heel with the Achilles tendon. On the side of the
        knee, the superficial muscle connects to the femur above the knee, and
        the deeper muscle to the tibia.
      </p>
      <p>
        In front and back views of the leg, you can see the calf flaring out
        near the top, and tapering off to the heel. The outside bump is usually
        located a bit higher than the inside one, although in some individuals
        it is almost symmetrical.
      </p>
      <li>Peroneus and tibialis</li>
      <p>
        You won't see these muscles often. Sometimes you can see the tendon of
        the peroneus behind the ankle, or their attachments near the knee.

    <p>
      Everything you've seen so far applies to both sexes. Although the
      illustrations show a skeleton with male proportions, the blueprint is the
      same for women. There is some overlap in the range of characteristics
      between the sexes, so keep in mind that everything you read here only
      applies to the average guy or gal. You'll find exceptions to every rule.
    </p>
    <h3>Musculature and fat</h3>
    <p>
      Women have less muscle mass, and (I'm probably risking my life by saying
      this) more fat. Everybody stores fat almost all around their body, with a
      few exceptions such as the scalp and the elbows. But men tend to store it
      as visceral fat, deep in the abdomen, and develop a beer gut. A woman's
      body prefers to store it as subcutaneous fat, just below the skin. This
      layer covers the muscles, and gives the body a softer, more rounded look.
      It tends to get stored more around the hips, the butt, the lower abdomen,
      the breasts, shoulders, and triceps.

      One of the most known tricks to make a face look more feminine is to give
      the character big, almond-shaped eyes, and put on some mascara and eye
      shadow. But there are also differences in the bone structure you can use:

    <h3>Ribcage and shoulders</h3>
    <p>
      Women have a smaller ribcage. Their collarbones are also shorter, so they
      don't have the broad, square shoulders men have.

    <h3>Breasts</h3>
    <p>
      Contrary to what some artists want you to believe, using a compass to draw
      breasts is not the most realistic way to go about it. Their shape is more
      like a teardrop, and determined by size, gravity, and the fact they are
      connected to the pectoral muscles. If these muscles stretch out, the
      breasts move along and their contour changes. For example, raising an arm
      will move the breast up:
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      As you can see in figure
      <a href="#basics-humananatomy-female-breastspect">2.36</a>, the contour
      lines are drawn only on the outside. This is because breasts don't point
      straight forward, but they are angled outward. As a guideline, the nipples
      point away from the spine:

    <h3>Hips</h3>
    <p>The male's pelvis is higher and narrower than a female's:</p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-humananatomy-maleandfemalepelvis">

    <p>
      A woman's hips are wider than her shoulders — with men it is the other way
      around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less obvious is the difference in the iliac crest (the two top ridges of
      the pelvis). It is more pronounced in women, and in 3/4 profile it can
      show up as a small bump in the outline of the hips:

    <br />
    <h2 id="basics-humananatomy-poses">Poses</h2>
    <p>
      Now it's time to put everything together and draw some poses. When drawing
      the skeleton and the muscles for a quick pose sketch, it would not make
      sense to detail everything as much as you've seen in this chapter.
      Instead, you should use this knowledge to determine what matters and what
      doesn't. For example, you usually would not take the shoulder blades into
      account. But when drawing a portrait of a character looking over a bare
      shoulder at the camera, it becomes an important aspect of the figure.
    </p>
    <h3>Simplifying the body</h3>
    <p>
      A common way to simplify the body is to draw a manikin from balls and
      cylinders.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-humananatomy-manikin-manikin">
      <img loading="lazy" src="images/manikin.webp" alt="A manikin" />
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 2.40. A manikin</strong></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      Looks a lot like the little wooden models you can buy at any art store,
      right? The head is somewhat closer to the shape of a skull, and the pelvis
      is closer to the shape of a real one. And while a normal wooden manikin
      has its shoulders held to the torso with bits of wire, ours has alien
      anti-gravity technology. This allows them to move around like a real
      shoulder can. In the side view you can see how the chest and the pelvis
      are tilted a little bit to follow the natural curve of the spine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another simplification is the ball and stick figure, which models the
      largest bones and joints in the body. It is great for quick sketching, but
      it does not show overlapping, foreshortening, and mass as well as a solid
      figure:
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-humananatomy-manikin-stickvsmanikin">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/stick-vs-manikin.webp"
        alt="Stick figure and solid model"
      />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 2.41. Stick figure and solid model</strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      As an alternative for the ball and stick figure, you can also draw a
      simplified skeleton. This can be useful in the case you have a difficult
      pose and no good reference — and you are really hell-bent on doing it
      exactly like you had it in mind.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-humananatomy-manikin-pose2skeleton">
      <img
        loading="lazy"

    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      Although it does not have much mass, it does show more depth than a stick
      figure. The extra work you have put in drawing a ribcage, clavicles, a
      pelvis, and whatnot, will pay off by the time you need the anchor points
      for your muscles.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-humananatomy-manikin-pose2muscles">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src=" images/pose-2-muscles.webp"
        alt="Adding muscles"
      />
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 2.43. Adding muscles</strong></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <h3>Weight, balance, movement</h3>
    <p>
      Every body has a center of mass; an imaginary point where gravity grabs a
      hold and pulls you down. Because the upper body is heavier than the legs,
      this point is located somewhat above the midule in a human being, in the
      underbelly between the tops of the hip bone crests. That is, if you're
      standing up straight. As soon as you bend over, extend an arm, or stick
      out your tongue, the point of mass moves along.
    </p>
    <p>
      To determine if a figure is balanced or not, draw a plumb line from the
      center of mass to the floor. The body should be supported at this exact
      point, for example by a foot, by two feet on either side of this point, or
      by two feet and a hand in a triangle around it.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-humananatomy-cog1">
      <img loading="lazy" src="images/cog-poses-1.webp" alt="Center of mass" />
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 2.44. Center of mass</strong></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      Here we see two standing figures. The one on the left is standing up
      straight, and the center of mass is located right above a point between
      the feet. The other manikin strikes a very old-school pose, the
      contrapost. This is a relaxed pose, where the body weight is shifted to
      one leg, and the shoulders and hips are tilted. If we draw a line down
      from the center of mass, it turns out that indeed most of the weight is
      carried by the right foot.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-humananatomy-cog2">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/cog-poses-2.webp"
        alt="The center of mass moves when the body bends"
      />
      <figcaption>
        <strong
          >Figure 2.45. The center of mass moves when the body bends</strong
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      The center of mass isn't always located at the same spot. Here you can see
      how it shifts along when the torso and arms move to a side. But as long as
      it remains above the feet, our manikin won't fall over.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the center of mass is not supported, the pose conveys motion. This
      could be a falling motion, or something more deliberate such as running,
      jumping, or dodging. For example, look at this sprinter, just before and
      just after the gun fired:

    </figure>
    <br />
    <h3>Gesture drawing</h3>
    <p>
      When creating a character reference sheet, you draw the figure upright,
      and perhaps do a full turnaround. But usually you want your poses to be
      dynamic, or at the very least interesting. This is where gesture drawing
      comes in. A gesture drawing is made very fast, you shouldn't spend more
      than two minutes on it. Fast, but not frantic.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-humananatomy-gesture-examples">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/gestures.webp"

      <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 2.47. Examples of gesture sketches</strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      Drawing is usually done from the arm, using the elbow and the shoulder.
      The pencil/charcoal/burned match is held in an overhand grip. This grip
      works even better on a slanted drawing board, or an easel.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-humananatomy-gesture-grip">
      <img
        loading="lazy"

      />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 2.48. Using an overhand grip</strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      There are several reasons to begin with gesture drawing. You can do it as
      a warming-up exercise. It can be a study of a life subject that isn't
      posing for you, and you need to get the essence of the pose or the motion
      down on paper quickly. You can do a few of them to familiarize yourself
      with a subject. Or you want to breathe more life into your characters.
      Whatever the reason, starting with a gesture sketch is usually a good
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a point where a lot of things you've learned so far come together.
      Your skills in measuring lengths and angles by sight, and finding the
      important lines allow you to capture the proportions. Simplifying to cubes
      and cylinders helps to get a feeling for mass and depth. Knowledge of
      anatomy allows you to refine the sketch even after your model is gone.
    </p>
    <h2 id="basics-humananatomy-exercises">Exercises</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Most image viewers have a slideshow option. This feature is great for
        practicing gesture drawing in the comfort of your own home. Collect a
        few photos of people. Clothed or not, in a static pose or doing sports,
        that is up to you. Just make sure the entire body is visible. Now turn
        on the slideshow and start sketching! Try varying the speed between 30
        seconds and 2 minutes. (Slowing down the slideshow is no reason to slow
        down yourself; keep moving that pencil fast enough to start a fire.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you feel more confident, and the weather is decent, you can
        practice almost anywhere. The park and the zoo are excellent places to
        find subjects.

      Drawing anthros isn't easy. Not only should the artist be able to draw the
      human figure, they must also be proficient at drawing different animal
      species. If you have been practicing the material from the previous
      chapters, this should be much easier:

      Here's a comparison between a generic four-legged animal, and a human

      Once you can draw the members of the canine family, you've got 70% of the
      fandom covered already. Here we will look at the family in general, and
      the characteristic differences between wolves, foxes, and a few domestic
      dogs.
    </p>
    <h3>Body</h3>
    <p>
      We'll show the canine body in somewhat more detail than the other species.
      The idea is that all quadrupeds have the same body structure, and we'll
      just have to highlight the differences for felines and equines.

    <h3>Head</h3>
    <p>
      I'm going to base the head off a ball, just like the one you saw in the
      first chapter. To indicate the muzzle, I also hotglue a box shape to it.
      Well not really a box, more a clipped pyramid. A dog's muzzle is wider
      near the back than at the front, so it's a better fit.

      This is a pretty generic dog head, good for huskies and such. For other
      breeds, you'll have to make a couple of changes. The chihuahua will have a
      much smaller wedge for the muzzle, while a dachshund is best drawn with a
      big wedge shape that models almost the whole head.

      <figcaption><strong>Figure 3.6. Front paw</strong></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      On the left we see the underside of a front paw. There are four cushiony
      pads at the toes (the digital pads), a larger one underneath the knuckles
      (the metacarpal pad), and a tiny one near the wrist (the carpal pad).
      There are four claws at the front, and a dewclaw at the end of the thumb.
      Note that the claws are not at the center of the toes, but on the inside.
      The two in the midule are very close together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The illustration next to it shows the bones of the front leg. The dog is
      standing up, so the toes are bent at nearly 90 degrees. On the right,
      there's a life drawing of the front leg of a sleeping dog; the toes are
      more relaxed and straightened out. Notice how the joints and muscles
      correspond to all kinds of bumps and curves, both in the contour and the
      shading. If you have the opportunity to study an actual dog, make good use
      of it! It is easier to see the structure of its legs in real life than on
      photos.

      Remember figure <a href="#basics-animalanatomy-comparehuman">3.1</a> at

      A dog's hind paws are almost the same as the front ones. The main
      difference is that there's no dew claw, or carpal pad. The new challenge
      here, especially for the artists who like to draw their characters
      digitigrade, is the hock.

      This family of agile hunters is arguably even more diverse than the
      canidae; from the purring little apex predator on your lap to the
      intimidating Siberian tiger, they come in a wide range of face markings,
      fur patterns, and accessories such as ear tufts or manes. We'll
      concentrate on the domestic cat first, and then take a look at some of his
      bigger cousins.

      Cats have a smaller, rounder muzzle than dogs, so for my construction

      of a box.

      Horses are very muscular animals with relatively thin fur, so their

    <h3>Head</h3>
    <p>
      The head can be drawn using a box with one side sliced off diagonally. The
      eye sockets stick out a bit, so I usually draw a kite on top of this box
      to place the eyes.
    </p>
    <h3>Hooves</h3>
    <p>
      The biggest difference between the skeletons we have seen so far and the
      horse skeleton is the hooves. What would be the third metacarpal in our
      hand (the bone from the wrist to the knuckle of the midule finger) is
      called the cannon bone in a horse. The second and fourth metacarpals (the
      splint bones) are still there, but they're tiny. You can still spot them
      as small bumps near the wrist. The first and fifth metacarpals have
      disappeared. The “midule finger” starts at the fetlock, and the fingertip
      is encased in a hoof.

    <h3>Body</h3>
    <h3>Wings</h3>
    <p>
      The bone structure in a bird's wing is very similar to the arm and the
      hand of a human. If you are drawing wings, pay attention to where the
      shoulder, the elbow, and the wrist go.
    </p>

      This figure also shows how the large flight feathers connect to the bones.
      The elbow joint might not always be clearly visible. In that case there is
      some skin stretching from the wrist to the shoulder smoothing out the
      contours.
    </p>
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>
      I have found several contradicting sources for the next few paragraphs.
      Information could be incorrect.

    <p>
      The feathers are shown in the following figure. This is a picture showing
      the top of a wing.

    <br />
    <p>
      The primary feathers are the ones connected to the "hand", while the
      secondaries are connected to the "forearm". Both sets of feathers also
      have a layer of coverts on top of them, followed by another layer of
      marginal coverts. On the inside of the wing, there are the scapular
      feathers, sometimes also called the tertiaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wing as seen from the bottom will show the same structure, but with
      somewhat shorter coverts. A complete list of all bird species and the
      particular wing shapes and feather sizes is far beyond the scope of this
      tutorial. But if you'd like to model your wings after a particular kind of
      bird, all you have to do is take a look at some photos, and identify the
      different feather groups. Once you know the structure of a wing, it is
      much easier to draw all the varieties.
    </p>
    <p>
      This side of the wing also has some feathers called the alula, which are
      connected to the “thumb”. These feathers are not visible from the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following examples of wings, the groups of feathers are colored in
      the same way as in figure
      <a href="#basics-animalanatomy-wingfeathers">3.16</a>. The bone structure
      is indicated with a blue line.

      Finally! With all this talk about the basics, one would almost forget
      we're here to draw anthros.
    </p>
    <h2 id="basic-anthros-head">Head</h2>
    <p>
      We've already covered the basics of constructing a head in chapters 1 and
      3. Here we'll take it a step further.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, eyes have been treated as flat things stuck on a sphere. While
      this works for some styles, it helps a lot to realize eyes are spheres
      themselves. The eye sockets are set deeper into the head.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-anthro-heads-eyes">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/head-construction-eyesockets.webp"
        alt="Sinking and raising features"
      />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 4.1. Sinking and raising features</strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      There are many features that are set deeper, or are raised higher (for
      example the the brow ridge or the cheek bone). Such dips and bumps change
      the contour of the basic sphere, and also create overlaps as the head
      turns.
    </p>
    <p>Now let's look at some examples and different styles.</p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-anthro-heads-ex1">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/head-construction-examples-1.webp"
        alt="Deer"
      />
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 4.2. Deer</strong></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      Here's the head of an anthro deer. I haven't changed much in terms of
      style; there are some small changes to the mouth and the eye, just to give
      him a sympathetic smile. And of course his neck is more human. No, most of
      the fun is in the construction of the antlers. The line between the tips
      of the antlers, tips of the ears, and the front of the muzzle are all
      parallel (and very slightly corrected for perspective). His antlers are
      not easily simplified, so I just use direction lines to make sure they
      won't end up lopsided.
    </p>
    <p>Now let's try that again in a more toony style...</p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-anthro-heads-ex3">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/head-construction-examples-3.webp"
        alt="Deer, cartoon style"
      />
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 4.3. Deer, cartoon style</strong></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      The head is more human, actually; he has a bigger brain, and the eyes are
      placed lower and more to the front. The nose, the mouth, and the eyes have
      been made larger to make them more expressive.
    </p>
    <p>(TODO: bird heads)</p>
    <br />
    <figure id="contrib-banks-headex1">
      <img loading="lazy" src="images/head-examples-1.webp" alt="Squirrel" />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 4.4. <a href="#credit-banks">Squirrel</a></strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      More emphasis was put on humanizing her and giving her a very expressive
      face, as opposed to making her species crystal clear. The reason for the
      humped line in the under drawing was because a more squirrel-like form was
      first sketched out to make sure some of the animal would show through, and
      that was then whittled down to a character that humans could recognize as
      a very feminine being. She also has very hard angles and straight lines in
      her, as opposed to the curvy and rounded lines one would find in a
      realistic drawing.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="contrib-banks-headex2">
      <img loading="lazy" src="images/head-examples-2.webp" alt="Otter" />

        <strong>Figure 4.5. <a href="#credit-banks">Otter</a></strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      River otters are very bouncy creatures, so unless the goal is to draw a
      character atypical to the species (ie. a Killer Rabbit), you want the
      species' personality to show through in your drawing. Thus, this guy has
      some bold parallel curves in him to give him a more animated look than the
      more stoic and reserved looking squirrel has. The underdrawing looks a bit
      more ottery with that big ol' nose, round face, and almond eyes. Personal
      style was applied to the drawing, with the end result of an otter that
      looks slightly less than an otter, though one that has more of an
      individual look to him as opposed to looking like any old otter on the
      streets (or in the streams). The artist has to decide whether their
      project or drawing calls for a critter that can be identified by species,
      or one that can be identified as an individual, and how much of a balance
      between the two needs to be struck.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="contrib-banks-headex3">
      <img loading="lazy" src="images/head-examples-3.webp" alt="Iguana" />
      <strong>Figure 4.6. <a href="#credit-banks">Iguana</a></strong>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      Like the squirrel, many of the lines were straight and angular. His head
      was pretty much two rectangular shapes put together. In the finished
      drawing, the lines were rounded out in many places to give him a more
      natural look. As he was done in a more realistic style than the squirrel,
      he also has a different neck structure. Rather than having a thin neck
      that acts as a base for the skull like a human would, his neck is thick,
      and humps out from the back of his skull rather than just below it.
    </p>
    <h2 id="basic-anthros-legs">Legs</h2>
    <p>
      Most anthro characters can be broauly divided into two categories,
      depending on their legs. If they look more like human legs, so the entire
      sole of the foot is touching the ground, it is what is known as
      plantigrade:
    </p>
    <p>(TODO: example)</p>
    <p>
      You can also draw the legs more like an animal's. In this case, only the
      toes touch the ground, and the heel is lifted. This is called digitigrade.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-anthro-digitigradeexample1">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/digitigrade-example1.webp"

      />
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 4.7. Digitigrade legs</strong></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      In this example, the leg is overlaid with an x-ray. The hips and femur are
      human, but from the knee down the anatomy matches a horse's leg. Note that
      she still has the same joints as found in a normal leg, but the
      proportions are different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another possibility is to switch from human to animal anatomy at the foot,
      instead of at the knee. You could also say it's a plantigrade character
      walking on its toes.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2 id="basic-anthro-hands">Hands, paws, hooves...</h2>
    <p>
      Like with legs, there are several ways to throw a bit more human or a bit
      more animal in the mix. On one end of the spectrum, there are the normal
      human hands, but with a bit of fur and longer nails:
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-anthro-hands-humanoid1">

        <strong>Figure 4.9. Humanoid anthro hands</strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      A fifty-fifty mix of human and animal traits is quite common. Usually this
      is done by making the fingers shorter and shaped more like a paw, and by
      adding paw pads.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-anthro-hands-were1">

      Here the pads are placed according to the anatomy of the animal (as seen
      in the previous chapter), but you'll see many varieties. Some artists make
      the carpal pad as big as the hand, some use three small pads per finger,
      and some have even more intricate designs (such as Goldenwolf's).
    </p>
    <p>
      Some species have dewclaws, which could also be used as substitutes for
      thumbs or little fingers:

    <h2 id="basic-anthros-tail">Tail</h2>
    <p>
      The tail is an extension of the spine. When drawing bipedal characters,
      make sure the tail connects just below the sacrum, and that it flows
      naturally from how the spine is bent.
    </p>

    <h2 id="basic-anthros-body">Alternative bodies</h2>
    <p>
      Apart from the usual human body plan, you can also borrow some designs
      from mythology. A well-known example is the centaur. Usually this is a
      human head and torso with the body of a horse, but we can make any mix of
      species:
    </p>
    <p>(TODO: examples)</p>
    <p>
      Another mythical creature is the gryphon, a mix between an eagle and a
      lion, with some horse ears thrown in for good measure. You're not limited
      to a lion an an eagle though, any bird and four-legged animal will work:

      One of the problems with dragons and gryphons is how to attach the wings.
      The example shows the most common solution, which is to use the existing
      shoulder blades. Don't place the wings too far back!
    </p>
    <p>
      Others use more complicated ways of adding wings to a creature. Birds have
      specialized shoulder blades, and strong flight muscles that connect to a
      large bony blade projecting from the sternum. But the front legs are in
      the way... Perhaps putting the sternum further away will work? Different
      front legs? Two pairs of shoulder blades? Designing a critter this way can
      be a fun challenge.
    </p>
    <h2 id="basic-anthros-example">Example 1: Vixen</h2>
    <p>
      Let's look at an example that shows some of the key concepts from the
      tutorial so far. We're going to draw a vixen practicing with swords. I
      have this cool pose in mind where she's standing on one leg, her body bent
      to the side. I start with a fast gesture sketch to lay down the lines of
      action and indicate the most important features.

      The skeleton is for the largest part human. The upper legs and knee joints
      are normal, although the femur and the shin bone have been made somewhat
      shorter to compensate for the longer, animal metatarsals. Notice how the
      tail is connected to the pelvis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I wouldn't normally draw the skeleton in such detail. Or a stick
      figure with such clean lines. But by the time I'm satisfied with my
      sketch, it looks more like twenty tumbleweeds are having a spaghetti food
      fight. To the death. I've cleaned it up and drawn a more elaborate
      version, so at least you can see what's going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting the skeleton just right is the hardest part. Let's add some
      muscles:
    </p>
    <p>(TODO: add illustration)</p>
    <p>
      The final stage is drawing the outlines, detailing the face, hands, and
      paws, adding a tail, and a few tufts of hair. She could use some cleaning
      up and shading, so we'll keep this sketch for later.

      The bird being depicted is an anthropomorphic White Stork. These storks
      are somehow as graceful as they are gainly. A pose was picked to reflect
      their more delicate side, and photos of dancers were studied for
      inspiration. When working with anthro characters, a decision must be made
      as to how much human and how much animal anatomy is desired. For the
      stork, a human body was first sketched. However, it was made more
      bird-like in proportion by lengthening the arms, shortening the torso, and
      shortening the upper leg to allow for the long, lower stork legs to be
      added. The swooping stork neck, head, and long bill was then sketched out,
      and left fairly realistic in the hopes of making the viewer see a stork
      first, before noticing the human attributes.

      Beyond determining the blend of human and animal to use, another large
      deciding point is what sort of wings to choose. For the stork, the long
      human-like arms were covered in small feathers, and the fingers elongated
      and made more feathery. The large wing feathers were made more decorative
      than functional, to fit in with the dancing and airy pose. The tail and
      neck feathers were also made to look more like a decorative fringe than
      those found on the real bird. Many other types of wings are possible
      though, as we've seen earlier.

    <p>
      There are no specific exercises for this chapter. I encourage you to just
      draw anthros, and in the meantime keep on reading and learning. The only
      exercise I can think of is more of a suggestion: everywhere on the
      internet you can find art exchanges, where people draw eachother's
      characters. Chances are good your favorite forum has one. Join it! You'll
      force yourself to draw all sorts of species (perhaps some you've never
      even heard of), and keep drawing frequently (because of the deaulines).
      This is an excellent way to improve.

      Good light and shadows can do more than just make your work look three
      dimensional. It sets the atmosphere, organizes your drawing, and it could
      be an integral part of your composition. Value is also the most important
      aspect of color, so you're going to need these skills in the next chapter.
    </p>
    <h2 id="basics-lightshadow-basic">Basic shading</h2>
    <p>
      We'll start with the easiest shading: one light source, direct light only.
      If the light hits something straight on, the surface will appear at its
      brightest at that point. If you turn the surface away from the light, it
      gets gradually darker. At 90 degrees or more it appears at its darkest.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-lightshadow-shading">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/shading.webp"

      />

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      The brightness does not drop at a constant rate; at 45 degrees, the
      surface brightness is 70%. The surface is at half brightness at 60
      degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing this, let's look at how to shade some of the basic shapes from
      <a href="#basics-sketching">Chapter 1, <i>Sketching</i></a
      >:
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-lightshadow-shapesshading">
      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="images/shapes-shading.webp"

        <strong>Figure 5.2. Shading the basic shapes</strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      The light comes from the top left. Every shape has a core shadow, where
      the light can't reach. This area is a uniform dark color. From the edge of
      the shadow area, the ball and the cylinder get gradually lighter to the
      point where the surface is facing the light source directly. This edge is
      called the terminator.
    </p>
    <p>
      An object could also block the light from another object, in this case it
      casts a shadow. Shadows tend to get softer at the edges as the distance to
      the blocking object increases, because the light source is not completely
      obscured. In the next figure you can see the darkest part (the umbra) does
      not get much bigger to the right, but the soft edges (the penumbra ) do:
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-lightshadow-shadowfuzzy">

      <figcaption><strong>Figure 5.3. Soft shadow edges</strong></figcaption>

        <strong>Figure 5.4. Shadow cast by direct sunlight</strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      The softness of a shadow also depends on the size of the light source.
      Small ones, such as a canule flame, make sharper edges. If the light
      source is larger than the object, the darkest part of the shadow becomes
      short and triangular. At a certain distance, these shadows become very
      faint. A common example of this situation is skylight coming from a
      window.

    <br />
    <p>
      Keep in mind that shadows are a lack of light, so they don't get any
      darker where they overlap (assuming you are not using complex scenes with
      multiple light sources):
    </p>

      <figcaption><strong>Figure 5.7. Shadows do not add</strong></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      The orange area is the shadow that is cast by the flat top onto the
      cylinder. The blue area is the cylinder's own shadow. As you can see, the
      purple bit where they overlap is the same dark shade.

      The things you learned in
      <a href="#basics-sketching-geometric"
        >the section called “Geometric shapes”</a
      >
      will come in handy here. Since the basic geometric shapes are easier to
      shade than a detailed body, we're going to break down a figure into simple
      forms first.
    </p>
    <p>Here's the girl we're going to shade, I'm sure you remember her:</p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-lightshadow-figlineart">

        <strong>Figure 5.8. Line art for the shading example</strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      We break her down into simple shapes, and pick a direction for our light
      source. The first step is to shade according to the surface angle:
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-lightshadow-figshade1">
      <img
        loading="lazy"

      />
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 5.9. Self shadows only</strong></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>Then we add the cast shadows:</p>
    <p>(TODO: illustrations)</p>
    <p>
      This gives us a general idea of where to put the light and the dark areas.
      The final step is to refine this further:
    </p>
    <p>(TODO: text and illustrations)</p>
    <h2 id="basics-lightshadow-specularlight">Specular light</h2>
    <p>
      Normally, an object would reflect the incoming light scattered in all
      directions:
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-lightshadow-spherereflect">
      <img
        loading="lazy"

      <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 5.10. Light is scattered in all directions</strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      A shiny surface works a bit like a mirror though. If the green ball from
      the previous figure would be a billiard ball, it reflects some of the
      white light like a mirror, and scatters the rest around as green light:
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-lightshadow-spherereflect2">
      <img

    <br />
    <p>
      The result is that you'll see a bright white spot somewhere. This spot is
      called a specular highlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that a specular highlight usually appears at a different position
      than the object's most brightly lit area. The brightest part depends only
      on the position of the light source, while the specular's depends on both
      the light source and the position of the viewer. (If you would walk
      around, the specular would also appear to move across the object.)
    </p>

        </strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      The size of the highlight depends on how smooth the object is. A polished
      billiard ball with have a small, bright spot. A rubber ball will have a
      larger, fuzzier, duller highlight:
    </p>
    <p>(FIXME: add photo)</p>
    <h2 id="basics-lightshadow-ambientlight">Ambient and reflected light</h2>
    <p>
      So far, we have been dealing with only one light source. In the world
      around us, such a situation is very rare. Objects are usually illuminated
      from nearly all around, with light of different colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take an outdoor scene. The most obvious source would be the sun, which
      emits an almost white light. But there's also the light from the sky,
      basically a dome that casts a weaker, blueish light on everything from all
      around.
    </p>
    <br />
    <figure id="basics-lightshadow-sunlight">
      <img
        loading="lazy"

        <strong>Figure 5.13. Direct sunlight and ambient skylight</strong>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      Combined, this will change the way we should shade our basic shapes:
      (FIXME: add illustration showing blue ambient)
    </p>
    <p>
      This explains why artists usually blend in some blue with their shadows.
      I've come across several documents that claim a shadow has the
      complementary color of the light source. This is not true; they will have
      whatever is the color of the ambient light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Illuminated objects can work as light sources of their own as well. This
      effect is called reflected light, or radiosity. For example, in this photo
      the red cap casts a soft light on the shadow side of the white tube:
    </p>
    <br />

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br />
    <p>
      The bottom of the sphere isn't deep black, because of the reflected light
      from the surface the sphere is resting on. There's also a soft specular
      highlight in there.
    </p>
    <p>
      An excellent example of reflected light can be seen in the painting “Kemsa
      KelTaq” by Damalia.

      In fact, this painting is a superb example of lighting in general,
      composition, anatomy, texture, and the use of a complementary palette.
      But, one thing at a time! The character is lounging on an orange cloth
      that acts as a faint light source. Take a moment to study how the soft
      orange glow is cast from underneath into the shadow areas. This is easiest
      to spot on the shins, her left arm, and the blue pillow.

        Put a white egg on a white piece of paper. Use a lamp as your light
        source, and minimize the amount of ambient light (make the rest of the
        room dark, but light enough to be able to work). Draw or paint this
        scene, paying attention to all the effects from this chapter. But try
        not to exaggerate the effects, keep your values close to what you
        actually see.
        <br />

        <br />
        The cast shadow, core shadow, and reflected light can be easily seen.
        But there are more subtle effects as well. Can you see the light the egg
        reflects onto the table? Notice how the table does not illuminate the
        underside of the egg uniformly; the egg is darker on the back and where
        it touches the table. Can you see this? Any idea why this happens?
      </li>
      <li>
        Draw an object (whatever you have in reach) two or three times, with
        different light sources. For example, one with the light coming from the
        left, and one from behind. You can do this from your imagination, using
        only the shape of the object as your reference, or from real life, by
        moving the light source or the subject.
      </li>
      <li>
        Try to shade with only two tones. Try not to rely on lines for bringing
        out the shapes, but use the edges between light and dark instead.
        Knowing how to do this will help you at the stage of blocking in your
        colors, or making an underpainting.
